v1.4.26
- Added `-i, --increased` option to only show drives with important attributes that have changed since last time the script was run.
  - Useful for when the script is scheduled so you only get sent an email when important attributes have increased, or decreased.
  - For SAS drives the `-i, --increased` option monitors "Elements in grown defect list".
- Now SAS drives' important attributes are shown in default mode (when no options used).
- Now sorts drives by DSM drive number (instead of sorting by `/dev/sata1` or `/dev/sda` etc).
  - Expansion unit drives are show after internal drives.
  - For more than 1 expansion unit their drives are sorted by expansion port number.
- Now for NVMe drives in a PCIe M.2 card the PCIe M.2 card model is shown like "M.2 Drive 1-1 (E10M20-T1)".
- Bug fix for NVMe important SMART attribute's number showing in yellow instead of white when script run in default mode or with `-1, --increased` option.
- Bug fix for HDDs/SSDs not showing important SMART 10 attribute's value in red if greater 0.
- Bug fix for non-Seagate HDDs/SSDs not showing important SMART 1, 7 and 195 attribute's value in red if greater 0.
- Bug fix for Seagate HDDs (and HAT3300) not showing important SMART 1, 7 and 195 attribute's value in red if greater 0 and smartctl 7 not installed.

v1.3.19
- Improved display of all attributes for NVMe drives.
- Important attributes now shown in yellow for NVMe drives the same as for HDDs.
- Nicer display of all attributes for NVMe drives when smartctl 7 is installed.
- Added SMART overall health status for NVMe drives when smartctl7 is installed.

v1.3.18
- Added support for decoding Synology HAT3300 (Seagate) SMART attributes 1, 7 and 195 if smartctl v7 is installed.
  - Installing the Syno Community's "SynoCli Disk Tools v4.0-13" or later package to install smartctl v7.4
  - Download the latest SynoCli Disk Tools package from https://synocommunity.com/package/synocli-disk
- Bug fixes for SMART Error Counter Log.

v1.3.17
- Bug fix for showing "No errors logged" when smartctl returned "Error Counter logging not supported" due to missing `-d sat` or `-d sas`. Issue #30

v1.3.16
- Added TB/GB/MB for NVMe data_units_read and data_units_written.

v1.3.15
- Fix for SAS drives. Thanks @PeterSuh-Q3. Discussion #24

v1.3.14
- Modified smart_all() function [Adjust output indentation using Python script]. Thanks @PeterSuh-Q3

v1.3.13
- Bug fix for "195 Hardware_ECC_Recovered" incorrectly being padded with 2 leading spaces as "  195 Hardware_ECC_Recovered".

v1.3.12
- Changed to show expansion unit model and port number if drive is in an expansion unit.

v1.3.11
- Changed to also show device name (/dev/sata1, /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1 etc).

v1.3.10
- Added support for decoding Seagate SMART attributes 1, 7 and 195 if smartctl is v7 is installed.
  - Installing the Syno Community's "SynoCli Disk Tools v4.0-13" or later package to install smartctl v7.4
  - Download the latest SynoCli Disk Tools package from https://synocommunity.com/package/synocli-disk
- Changed to exit with code greater than zero if any SMART attributes' values are greater than 0 (for those that should be 0).
  - Useful when script is scheduled with "Send run details by email" and "Send run details only when the script terminates abnormally" are ticked.

v1.2.9
- Bug fix for skipping some drives in models that use sda, sdb etc.  Issue #9

v1.2.8
- Enabled support for USB HDDs and SSD drives (skips USB flash drives).

v1.1.7
- Bug fix for bash 4.3 (DSM 6).

v1.1.6
- Added green PASSED if drive is okay.
- Now shows all the important SMART attribute values.
- Now shows the DSM Drive number or M.2 Drive number so you can more easily identify which drive is which.
- Now shows the hostname as well as Synology model and DSM version (in case you have multiple of the same model).
- Now gets USB drive's serial number.

v1.0.3
- Added exit code to trigger task scheduler email if a drive has SMART errors.

v1.0.2
